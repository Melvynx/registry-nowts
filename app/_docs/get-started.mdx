## About Now.ts

**Now.ts** is a **shadcn/ui component library** that provides FullStack components ready to copy and paste into your projects. Unlike traditional UI libraries that focus only on visual components, our vision is to offer **complete FullStack components** that include both frontend and backend logic.

## Vision

Provide developers with **FullStack components** that are:
- ðŸ”§ **Complete**: Frontend + Backend logic included
- ðŸ“‹ **Copy-paste ready**: Install via shadcn registry
- ðŸš€ **Production-ready**: Battle-tested in real applications
- ðŸŽ¯ **Focused**: Each component solves a complete use case

## Installation

All components are installed using the **shadcn/ui registry system**:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.nowts.app/r/[component-name].json
```

### Example installations:

```bash
# Install Better Auth OTP component
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.nowts.app/r/better-auth-otp.json

# Install Server Toast component  
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.nowts.app/r/server-toast.json
```

## Available Components

### Better Auth OTP
Complete authentication system with email OTP - includes both client components and server actions.

### Server Toast
Server-side toast notifications that work with Next.js Server Actions - includes cookie management and client optimizations.

## How it works

1. **Browse components** in the documentation
2. **Copy the installation command** for the component you need
3. **Run the shadcn command** to add it to your project
4. **Follow the usage examples** in each component's documentation

- âœ… **Complete functionality** out of the box
- âœ… **Server and client code** included
